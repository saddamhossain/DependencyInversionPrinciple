# SOLID Principles

**SOLID** principles are the software design principles that enable us to manage most of the software design problems. SOLID is a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, in the early 2000s.

**SOLID** is an acronym where:

- **S** stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** stands for Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** stands for Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** stands for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** stands for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

In this repository, we embrace the **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**. This is what DIP means:

- High level module should not depend on low level module. Rather they should depend on abstraction.
